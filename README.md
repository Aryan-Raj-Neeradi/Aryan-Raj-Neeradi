Projects:
---
* **ReconSmart - Open Source Tool**: Automated domain reconnaissance through ReconSmart, streamlining subdomain enumeration, IP extraction, service identification, and domain status categorization, spidering, and automated
screenshot capturing of both working and non-working domains, enhancing information gathering for penetration
testers and security professionals.

* **Vulnerability Scanner and Exploit Tool**: Developed a tool that scans network assets for vulnerabilities and provides exploitation proof-of-concepts for educational and controlled environments. Built using Python, Nmap, and public CVE databases.

* **Automated Malware Analysis Sandbox**: Created an isolated environment that automates malware analysis, giving detailed reports on behavior, network activity, and detection evasion techniques using Python scripts and reverse engineering.

* **Bug Bounty Research Reports**: Performed and documented ethical hacking attempts on publicly available bug bounty programs. Submitted successful vulnerability disclosures and contributed to enhancing security posture.

* **Secure Web Application Demo**: Developed a basic yet secure web app with user authentication, XSS/SQLi protections, and session handling to demonstrate OWASP Top 10 security principles. Built using Django (Python), with SQLite as the backend database.

* **Name sorting and dupicate counter**: A lightweight, Excel-like web tool built using HTML and JavaScript to efficiently track names. Features include auto-suggestions, alphabetical and frequency-based sorting, CSV export, keyboard-based input, and individual entry deletion — all running fully offline using browser localStorage.
